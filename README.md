This project aims to build a sample landing page whose navigation menu is built at run time using vanilla Javascript.

Smooth scrolling to various sections is implemented. Distinguishing the various sections by highlighting the corresponding section
and menu item while scrolling the page is implemented using the `IntersectionObserver` API.

A button which helps the user to navigate to top of the page, smoothly has been added at the end of the page.

Javascript functions including the helper functions are written as ES6 arrow functions.
